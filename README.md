# Astronomy Picture Of the Day Desktop Background

A mini program to set the desktop background image to the NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day, every day, using [NASA's APOD](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api/tree/master)

## NOTES:

1. This is only currently working on Windows systems, specifically Windows 10+
2. For it to update every day, you need to make a shortcut of the ToAPODBackground.py, then place that shortcut in the shell:startup folder. (Which you can get to by doing Win+R and typing in shell:startup, then clicking OK)
